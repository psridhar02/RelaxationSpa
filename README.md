Preethi Sridhar

## Project Overview
Coastal Oasis Spa is a fictional luxury relaxation spa based in Honolulu, designed as part of a Software Engineering Bootcamp project: Project 01: Basic Business Website. The website showcases spa services, amenities, and a calming aesthetic inspired by tropical island getaways. It uses a modern design powered by Bootstrap and includes features like an image carousel, service sections, a faux Instagram-style showcase and even a function booking form.

## How to Use
- Navigate the site using the top navigation bar which contains the Home, About, Photo Gallery, Spa Services, and Booking section buttons
- Users can view spa highlights in the image carousel 
- The booking form allows users to book services and add any additional comments/preferences (via formspree.io integration)
- Check out a realistic Instagram-style preview with carousel!

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- [Bootstrap 5](Lux theme from Bootswatch)  
- Google Fonts  
- Font Awesome / Custom SVG Icons  
- Git & GitHub

## Ideas for Future Improvement  
1. Implement a real time booking calendar that shows times that are booked vs. times that are available.
2. Add a customer reviews section where users can upload their reviews into the website directly.
3. Incorporate animations for a more dynamic user experience.
